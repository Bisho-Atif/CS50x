0.  It is the maximum length for a word.

1.  getrusage()  returns  resource usage measures for our calling process "RUSAGE_SELF" which is the sum of all resources consumed by all the threats in the program.

2.  16 field.

4.  First, It checks the command-line arguments for the dictionary inputted. Then, it puts the large dictionary by default. Next, It makes a char with the max size of the word and iterates with a 
    for-loop through each word in the text and put it to the char-array "word", And while that, It checks for the index to be more than the maximum word size and ignoring the rest of the word. It also 
    checks for words contain numbers and ignoring it. then is checks for the word to be in the dictionary.  

5.  Because we iterate through every word char by char. It will be useless to use fscanf for one byte each time. "scanf" is used instead for the known-length-structures.

6.  Because the parameter inputted is our dictionary and its head pointer is constant through all the program.
